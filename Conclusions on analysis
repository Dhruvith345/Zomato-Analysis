#Conclusions:
#1.Cuisines don't matter on rating
#2.Average cost also doesn't affect the rating
#3.Type of restaurants do matter
#casual dining is preferred the most
#quick bites is not that preferred
#4.Now the way we increase the sales is showing content more of casual dining restaurants and much less
#on quick bites
#we have few restaurants that have higher rating but lesser number of ratings
#we need to advertize them,show them more,give extra offers discounts so that more customers are attracted to it
#there by we will get more restaurants with higher rating and good number of customers
